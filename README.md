# GemmaRead

An offline-first LLM-powered tutor for reading, made to help combat illiteracy in areas or for people with lack of resources (like hardware limitation and low-connectivity), which would otherwise make other learning platforms unusable.
We utilize FastAPI endpoints so that our Python backend can communicate with our React frontend. Ollama is used to serve a local copy of Gemma 3n
(This project was originally made to submit to the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge)
